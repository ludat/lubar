lubar
=====

My stupid little attempt at learning C better and making a more complete status bar along the way.

**This is not in any way complete. This file is only to order my thoughts as they appear.**

Description
-----------

This is a lighweight status bar which uses cairo and pango to provide full UTF-8 support, images and drawing vectors. **(Nothing of this is implemented yet of course)**

Command line options
--------------------

lubar [-g WIDTH**x**HEIGHT**[+-]**X**[+-]**Y | -f FONT | -bg COLOR | -fg COLOR]
